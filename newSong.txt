This will never end ′cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more

This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more

This will never end ′cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more

This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more


If I had a heart, I could love you
If I had a voice, I would sing
After the night, when I wake up
I′ll see what tomorrow brings
